# Movie Recommendation System using Stacked AutoEncoders (PyTorch)
This project implements a Stacked AutoEncoder for movie recommendations using PyTorch, a powerful and flexible deep learning framework. The model learns latent representations of users and movies from the rating matrix to predict unseen preferences. Ideal for those exploring collaborative filtering with deep learning
